# ESP32-Arduino-based-H-Bridge-motor-driver

A library for Arduino based ESP32 programming of motor drivers. It supports both direct mode and quadrature encoders.

It uses the ledc for PWM control of H-Bridge motor drivers.

Quadrature encoders can be hooked up with interupt functions for counting encoder pulses.
